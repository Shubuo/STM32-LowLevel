The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the STM 'STM32F100RB' 
microcontroller using ST STM32-Discovery Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL        =  8 MHz
   - HCLK        = 24 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - press BUtton USER1 to switch between the LEDs.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  STM32F100RB RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                     (used for target debugging)
  STM32F100RB Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                     (used for production or target debugging)
